                    <p> Hi. I'm your future husband. Even though we haven't met yet, I just want to say how grateful I am to you for loving me. Right now seems like I'm not coming to you, but please don't give up on me. As I am searching for you with all my heart. </p><br/>
                    
                    <p>I know that you are not just my wife. You are also my bestfriend, a bestfriend whom I like to spend my whole life with. I will treat you as my queen, as what you really are. With you it all makes sense. With you I will realize how it is to love someone unconditionally. I feel like my life's purpose is to love you and our family together. Whatever is it to you, I'll accept and love wholeheartedly. And I am hoping you will do the same. </p><br />

                    <p>I maybe a little late to be your first to every romantic thing out there, but I will make sure to be your last and to make our every moment together as memorable as possible. One thing is for sure, that I will always be there for you, no matter what. God knows how much I will love you for the rest of my life. I can't wait to marry you, cause I know are the love of my life. I love you.</p>
